-This is my first build using the existing site, GOOGLE.com

-For The Odin Project Introductory course: http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css

-P.S.-I don't know when to use terminal and when to use VS Code

Update--

-Took a few days. First had to almost scrap the whole code due to over thinking and lack of expeirience.
I woke up in the middle of the night with the answer, believe it or not.
It still took 7hrs to "complete". ~14hs total, and there's still more I could do to make it really 'mimic' the GOOGLE webpage.

-Perhaps, after more experience, I can revisit this project to fix css errors.
